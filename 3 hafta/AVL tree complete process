AVL – DSW – Self-Adjusting Tree Application
Step 1 – AVL Tree Formation
The given character sequence is:
S, E, L, İ, M, K, A, Ç, T, I

These characters are inserted one by one into an AVL tree using alphabetical comparison rules. After each insertion, balance factors are checked and AVL rotations are applied if necessary.

Final properties of the AVL tree:
- Root node: L
- Leaf nodes: A, I, K, M, T

AVL rotations used:
- LL Rotation: Applied when insertion occurs in the left subtree of the left child.
- RR Rotation: Applied when insertion occurs in the right subtree of the right child.
- LR Rotation: Left child is right-heavy; left rotation followed by right rotation.
- RL Rotation: Right child is left-heavy; right rotation followed by left rotation.

Final AVL Tree (ASCII Diagram):

        L
      /   \
     E     S
    / \   / \
   A   K M   T
        \
         I

Step 2 – DSW (Day–Stout–Warren) Method
Goal of DSW:
"To reduce tree height to the minimum possible level."

Developers:
- Colin Day
- Quentin F. Stout
- Bette L. Warren

Two main steps:
1. Creating the backbone (vine) using right rotations.
2. Balancing the backbone using left rotations.

Backbone (Vine) Representation:

A -> E -> I -> K -> L -> M -> S -> T

Balanced Tree After DSW (ASCII Diagram):

        L
      /   \
     I     S
    / \   / \
   A   K M   T

Step 3 – Self-Adjusting Tree (Frequency Based)
In a self-adjusting tree, each node stores an access frequency.
When a node is accessed:
- Frequency is increased by 1.
- Priority rotations move the node closer to the root.

This ensures that frequently accessed elements remain near the root.

Example After Repeated Access to M:

        M
      /   \
     L     S
    / \     \
   I   K     T
  /
 A

Step 4 – C# Console Application Summary
The C# program includes:

AVL Functions:
- Insert()
- RotateLeft(), RotateRight()
- GetHeight(), GetBalance()
- Tree traversal methods

DSW Functions:
- CreateBackbone()
- BalanceBackbone()
- ApplyDSW()

Self-Adjusting Tree Functions:
- SearchWithFrequency()
- PriorityRotate()
- AdjustTowardsRoot()

When the program runs, it prints:
1. Final AVL Tree
2. Tree after DSW balancing
3. Tree after self-adjusting access
